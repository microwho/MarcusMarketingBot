MARCUS: Hoth is a great choice for a resort! It's a beautiful planet with a lot of potential. However, you need to be aware of the competition. There are already a few resorts on Hoth, so you'll need to make sure your resort is unique and appealing to potential customers. You'll also need to make sure your marketing is on point. Fortunately, I'm an expert in marketing, so I can help you with that!
